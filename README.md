betararef
=========

Compute rarefied beta diversity and simulate communities (R package).  Accompanies Stier et al., "Isolating the effects of patch size and sampling effects on beta diversity via rarefaction", in prep.

**Installation**: for now, use `library(devtools); install_github("betararef","bbolker")` (don't forget `library("betararef")` to load the package). Then `help(package="betararef")` to see what's available.
